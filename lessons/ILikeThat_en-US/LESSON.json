How does the sensitivity of our eyes affect how we perceive and interact with the world?\n\n#### Essential Question(s):\nHow can science help deepen our understanding of the Arts, Humanities, and ourselves?\n#### Hook(s):\nWarm-up puzzles, fun student-driven experiments, and original artwork are woven into this data-centered lesson.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will conduct experiments and analyze real scientific data as they **learn about themselves**. They'll learn how our eyes and brains interact to determine what we like and dislike, and apply this knowledge to fish research and the art of character design.",

      "Description": "This lesson equips students with a simple framework for understanding how inputs from our senses are processed in the brain to determine what we like vs. dislike and how we behave. Though the lesson focuses on vision, the framework applies to all the senses. \n\nIn Part 1, students begin by ranking 10 images based on their arbitrary preferences. They then conduct an experiment (taking turns as a \"scientist\" and \"subject\") to try and understand **why** they ranked things the way they did. This is lesson both involves authentic, novel, science, but should also grow students' curiosity and understanding of their own decision-making.\n\nPart 2 builds on the framework introduced in Part 1 in the context of a real study (see #background) on fish. Students will analyze box plots (a type of graph similar to bar plots) to test whether female darters prefer a model fish painted a color that is most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e cones in their retinas). Students will reflect on how basic research on fish applies to humans.\n\nPart 3 perfectly blends art, math, and science by testing whether creatures that have proportions outside the range of humans makes them inherently creepy or cute. For this lesson, we created an original set of creature designs that have scaled dimensions which students will use to collect data and calculate proportions. They will then conclude whether having certain proportions (e.g. a large ratio of leg-to-torso-length) far above or below the range of humans makes a creature inherently creepy or cute.\n\nCollectively, this lesson should leave students with a nuanced understanding of how human (and other animal) brains process different sensory stimuli to affect preferences and behavior. It's a great starting-off point for deepening interest and engagement for independent projects."

This basic framework is adapted from human and animal behavior research. We use this framework throughout the middle school-targeted lesson below. In the lesson, students perform an experiment to understand their own preferences and dive into research on fish, exploring how sensitivity to different frequencies of light affects mate preferences. We dive into this topic in detail in our second video supporting this lesson.",
