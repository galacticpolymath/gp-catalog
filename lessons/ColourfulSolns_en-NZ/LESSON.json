The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students’ curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (Māori) dye technology.",

      "Description": "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the colours we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a brief, but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology. There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart 1 is a “student expert” or [“jigsaw” activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)), where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000 year old dye created from sea snails); Tānekaha Red (a traditional Māori dye derived from tree bark); and mauveine (the first synthetic dye—created from fossil fuels—and invented by a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on student understanding of these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability, cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately, this lesson aims to broaden students’ conception of what technology is and to better understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as a career.\n"
