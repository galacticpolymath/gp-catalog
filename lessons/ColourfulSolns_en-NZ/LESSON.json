The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students’ curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (Māori) dye technology.",

How have some animals benefited by evolving to stand out, while others survive by blending in? Why do some colors make us happy while others make us, well, blue? The Nature of Color, a new exhibition now open at the American Museum of Natural History reveals how color carries information both in nature and across cultures.",
