"term","definition"
"algorithm","a set of steps, like a mathematical recipe"
"alphabetic shift","type of cipher where each letter has been shifted a certain number of places (dictated by the algorithm)"
"cipher","a secret message that uses an algorithm to make a message seem like nonsense"
"decipher","1) to convert a secret message into readable text; 2) to succeed in understanding something "
"encipher","convert readable text (plaintext) into a secret message"
"plaintext","readable text (not a cipher)"
"data visualization","a representation of numbers or other types of data in a way that makes it easier to see patterns. Ex: scatter plots, histograms, & other types of graph"
"analyzing","organizing and exploring data to unlock its meaning"
"range","a set of two numbers: the least and the greatest number in a data set. Usually expressed as Small Number – Big Number"
"dot plot","a graph with one point for each data observation"
"binned dot plot","a dot plot where observations have been binned into ranges"
"histogram","a type of bar graph showing the distribution of a set of measurements for 1 variable. A common pattern (called a ""normal distribution"") is bell-shaped, with most observations having values close to the average, with about equal, increasingly rare measurements that are very high or very low. Human height is a good example of a normal distribution, with many ""average/medium"" height individuals, and very few individuals being significantly shorter or taller than all the rest."
"scatter plot","a graph showing the relationship between two continuous variables. Each data point represents the measurement for variable X and variable Y for a particular individual."
"binning","combining groups of observations into ranges. The bins could be ranges (like 0-5, 6-10, etc), or named categories, like when we classify people into “short,” “average,” and “tall” height categories."
"binned data","summary data where measurements have been combined into bins (ranges)"
"raw data","original, unmodified measurements"
