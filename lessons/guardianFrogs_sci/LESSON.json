      "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?\n- Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?\n#### Essential Question(s):\n- How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?\n- Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?\n#### Learning Objective(s):\n1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates in survival and reproduction.\n2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.\n3. Understand that biological data are variable.\n4. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.\n5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.\n6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why biological exceptions matter to science and society.\n\n#### Hooks\n- Part 1: Highly interactive card-based activity that simulates data collection + amazing animal videos\n- Part 2: Atmospheric videos of Borneo, first person narrative of an early career Latina scientist + use of authentic data \n",

      "Description": "This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students \"collect\" data through a card-based activity called \"Role With It.\" Briefly, students get a male or female card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with a \"song\" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for that species. Once they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze this data to generate a general observation: \"across nonhuman animal species, females tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment), while males tend to be more adapted to attracting and competing for mates. These are known as *conventional sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed species,* such as jacanas (a bird) and guardian frogs, which have \"caring\" males and \"competitive\" females.\n\nPart 2 dives into fascinating geography, videos from the field, and real data to test whether the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavenensis*) is truly the first known sex-role-reversed frog species, with caring males and competitive females. The lesson begins with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights, sounds, and mysteries of the island of Borneo. Students are then given a brief introduction to the geography of the region and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos' research in the forests of Brunei. Students analyze her actual data to test hypotheses by synthesizing information and analyzing a scatter plot to determine that this fascinating species is indeed the first frog known to have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" \n\nThe lesson offers a wide variety of opportunities for student movement, collaboration, creativity, and active engagement.\n"

          "description": "Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos discovers that in the smooth guardian frog of Borneo, female frogs call. In frog species, typically male frogs call, while females stay silent. Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos shows that in the smooth guardian frog of Borneo (Limnonectes palavanensis) this is not the case and that female frogs call, too, producing spontaneous vocalizations to attract males. Dr. Goyes-Vallejos’ discovery that female frogs call suggests that L. palavanensis exhibits a reversal in calling behavior and possibly a sex-role-reversed mating system, which would be the first ever observed in a frog species.

They are then more invested in understanding cases of *sex role reversed species* that are the exceptions to this role, and have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" In part 2, they dive into the hypothesis-based framework and follow along in the footsteps of an early career Latina scientist, Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos. They analyze real graphs and data she collected on the island of Borneo to determine if the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*) is the first sex-role-reversed frog species known to science. \n#### Research Background\n #### Research Background\n\n#### Scientific Paper\n![Screenshot of scientific journal article](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/guardianFrogs_sci/goyespaper.png)\n[Link to study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C43&q=doi.org%2F10.1007%2Fs00265-017-2323-3&btnG=)\n",

      "Description": "This Galactic Polymath Learning Chart illustrates the areas of knowledge covered. This lesson targets Science, but it helps teach national learning standards in 4 subjects: \n- [Common Core Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/); [Common Core ELA](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/); [Next Generation Science (NGSS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/); and [College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Social Studies Standards](https://www.socialstudies.org/standards/c3).\nIn total, there are 15 standards across US grade band(s): 5-6, 7-8.",
      "Footnote": "**Notes on Standards**\n\n*Standards are broken down into ***Target*** and ***Connected*** categories. Target standards are directly reinforced or taught; connected standards are not fully addressed in the lesson, but connected enough to provide a foundation for teachers to build upon.",
