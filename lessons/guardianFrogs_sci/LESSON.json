      "Text": "#### Driving Question(s):\n- Across animal species, is there truth to the stereotype that males are “competitive,” while females are “caring”, or is this an oversimplification?\n- Are the smooth guardian frogs of Borneo the first known species of frog with “competitive females” and “caring males”?\n#### Essential Question(s):\n- How can we use scientific methods to identify a general pattern?\n- Why do exceptions matter in science and in life?\n#### Learning Objective(s):\n1. Explain how animal behavior facilitates in survival and reproduction.\n2. Collect, reorganize, and analyze data to identify a pattern (that males tend to have adaptations to compete for mates, while females provide more parental care), and interpret exceptions to that pattern.\n3. Understand that biological data are variable.\n4. Learn to test hypotheses by interpreting authentic scientific graphs and data.\n5. Cite evidence to support explanatory claims.\n6. Integrate multiple lines of evidence to explain why exceptions matter in biology and other disciplines.\n\n#### Hooks\n- Part 1: Highly interactive card-based activity that simulates data collection + amazing animal videos\n- Part 2: Atmospheric videos of Borneo, first person narrative of an early career Latina scientist, authentic data \n",

Part 2 sets a mysterious atmosphere with an introduction to the sights and sounds of Borneo, and students will interact with real data to follow in the footsteps of a young Latina scientist."

This lesson targets Science, but it helps teach national learning standards in 4 subjects: \n- [Common Core Math](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/); [Common Core ELA](http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/); [Next Generation Science (NGSS)](https://www.nextgenscience.org/); and [College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Social Studies Standards](https://www.socialstudies.org/standards/c3).\nIn total, there are 15 standards across US grade band(s): 5-6, 7-8.",
      "Footnote": "**Notes on Standards**\n\n*Standards are broken down into ***Target*** and ***Connected*** categories. Target standards are directly reinforced or taught; connected standards are not fully addressed in the lesson, but connected enough to provide a foundation for teachers to build upon.",
