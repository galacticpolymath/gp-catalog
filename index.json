The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students\u2019 curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (M\u0101ori) dye technology.",

        "Description": "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the colours we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a brief but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology. There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart 1 is a \u201cstudent expert\" / [\"jigsaw\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)) activity, where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000-year-old dyeing method that uses sea snails); T\u0101nekaha Red (a traditional M\u0101ori dye derived from tree bark); and mauveine (the first synthetic dye\u2014created from fossil fuels\u2014and invented by a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on students' understanding of these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability, cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately, this lesson aims to broaden students\u2019 conception of what technology is and to better understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as a career.\n"

The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students\u2019 curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (M\u0101ori) dye technology.",

        "Description": "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the colors we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a brief but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology. There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart 1 is a \u201cstudent expert\" / [\"jigsaw\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)) activity, where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000-year-old dyeing method that uses sea snails); T\u0101nekaha Red (a traditional M\u0101ori dye derived from tree bark); and mauveine (the first synthetic dye\u2014created from fossil fuels\u2014and invented by a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on students' understanding of these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability, cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately, this lesson aims to broaden students\u2019 conception of what technology is and to better understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as a career.\n"

        "Description": "Students learn about genetic rescue, an approach for helping endangered populations recover by introducing closely related individuals from a different population. The lesson is framed around the story of Florida panthers, which are a classic success story for genetic rescue. In Part 1, students explore Florida panther recovery through the lens of different stakeholders (ranchers, city-dwellers, and Native Americans), discussing ways that each group may have positive or negative associations with panthers. \n\nIn Part 2, they then explore different options for helping panther recovery, discussing pros and cons of genetic rescue, captive breeding, or doing nothing. \n\nPart 3 provides necessary scaffolding for a deeper dive into genetic rescue by explaining key concepts in the context of Florida panthers. Students also do a card-based activity simulating matings to better understand why inbreeding and recessive traits are so problematic in small populations.\n\nPart 4, goes deeper into genetic rescue: what can go wrong? Students provide evidence of their understanding of how all the concepts connect through a concept mapping exercise, interspersed with our carefully crafted explainer videos. A key take-home is that even though genetic rescue worked in Florida panthers, it's quite risky to test out conservation strategies on an endangered species. The concluding task is to analyze a table of organisms and their characteristics to determine which would be good models to study the effectiveness of genetic rescue without risking a rare species' extinction. \n\nPart 5 builds on this to reveal Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's (this lesson's sponsor) research using Trinidadian guppies as a model of genetic rescue. Students then spend much of the class period analyzing real, paired data collected from Florida panthers and guppies. They are asked to compare and label graphs from both species, and synthesize broader conclusions. The lesson leaves open many options for project-based lessons and independent projects."

Here, we learn what happened and how wildlife managers tried to bring them back. Through this story, we explore connected concepts of how habitat fragmentation affects the flow of genes, and how this can lead to increasing risk of extinction in endangered species (the \"Extinction Vortex\"). The video ends with an open-ended question about what common species we could use to study endangered species recovery so that we don't run the chance of inadvertently destroying what we're trying to save.\nCheck out the lesson at https://www.galacticpolymath.com/lessons",

        "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n How do we save endangered species? This lesson deals with one option called *genetic rescue*\u2014a conservation strategy that involves moving individuals from one population into an endangered population that is highly inbred in order to add genetic variation to enable population recovery. Students learn about two distinct lines of research: one measuring the success of an attempt to save endangered Florida panthers; the other using wild Trinidadian guppies as a model of endangered species in order to better understand details of how genetic rescue can succeed or fail. \n#### Research Background\n Watch this video for a lot of panther background: [\u25b6'What is genetic rescue, and can we use it to save endangered species?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFQmNq8sJ2Y&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=2)  \n\nThe Florida panther is a unique subspecies (*Puma concolor coryi*) of the American puma (*Puma concolor*). It's not to be confused with black panthers, which are the dark (melanistic) forms of leopards or jaguars. The Florida panther was nearly driven to extinction by habitat loss, fragmentation, and targeted hunting. In the mid-1990s, there remained only a tiny ~20 individual population of panthers in south Florida, and they were highly inbred. They had a lot of recessive genetic abnormalities, including visible, superficial traits like: kinked tails and cowlicks in their fur, to more significant problems like: cryptorchidism (undescended testicles, causing infertility in males) and heart defects. Wildlife managers decided to relocate 8 female pumas from Texas (*Puma concolor couguar*) into Florida to introduce needed genetic variation.  \n\nStudents will get to analyze 20 years worth of monitoring data to assess whether genetic rescue was successful (it was! There are now over 200 Florida panthers). At the same time, students will compare these results to a paired data set in Trinidadian guppies to understand how model organisms can be used to answer scientific questions that are difficult to answer in an endangered or difficult-to-study species.\n\n#### Related Florida Panther Paper:\n![screenshot of panther study paper](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/VanDeKerk_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wmon.1041)\n\n\nThis video connects genetic rescue research on Florida panthers to the Trinidadian guppy model species: [\u25b6'Saving a species through genetic rescue: Why we need model organisms'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiXyHxv4Sx4&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=3)\n\nTo study many details of genetic rescue in a model system where we don't have to worry about inadvertently driving a species extinct, Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick and colleagues went to Trinidad. They took advantage of previous experiments that had moved guppies from a downstream population that had lots of genetic variation into upstream pools with only a few, highly inbred fish. \n\nThis genetic rescue experiment was indeed successful, and after only a few months, genetic variation increased and the population rebounded from around 20 individuals to over 1,000.\n\n\n#### Related Guppy Paper:\n![screenshot of Scientific Study](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/fitzpatrick_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356)\n\n#### Further Reading\n- [USFWS Florida Panther Profile](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/florida_panther/wah/panther.html)\n- [Nat Geo: Planned roads could imperil Florida's panthers\u2014and last remaining wilderness](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers?loggedin=true)\n- [The Florida Panther: Past, Present and Future](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/UW402)\n- [America\u2019s cat is on the comeback](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/americas-cat-is-on-the-comeback)\n- [Of kings and Alpine Ibex: the amazing resurrection of a species from near-extinction](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/59792-of-kings-and-alpine-ibex-the-amazing-resurrection-of-a-species-from-near-extinction)\n",

Summarize how human activities fragment animal populations and how habitat fragmentation limits gene flow, reducing genetic variation.\n3. Predict how increasing genetic variation by introducing new individuals (i.e. by conducting genetic rescue) will impact population size.\n4. Create a logic model showing how genetic rescue occurs; i.e. how the introduction of new individuals to a small, inbred population on the verge of extinction provides needed genetic variation for the population to survive and recover.\n5. Demonstrate understanding of how reduction in both population size and genetic variation in endangered species lead to the \"extinction vortex\"\u2014the increasing likelihood of small populations to blink out due to low population size and recessive genetics from inbreeding.\n6. Propose a model organism to use for research on species that are endangered or infeasible to study.\n7. Interpret scatter plot data from a model organism (Trinidadian guppies) and compare to related data in an endangered species (Florida panthers) to draw broader conclusions about the effectiveness of genetic rescue.\n8. Assess the potential risks and benefits of genetic rescue for a particular species, and propose a course of action.",

        "Description": "This lesson equips students with a simple framework for understanding how inputs from our senses are processed in the brain to determine what we like vs. dislike and how we behave. Though the lesson focuses on vision, the framework applies to all the senses. \n\nIn Part 1, students begin by ranking 10 images based on their arbitrary preferences. They then conduct an experiment (taking turns as a \"scientist\" and \"subject\") to try and understand *why* they ranked things the way they did. This is lesson both involves authentic, novel, science, but should also grow students' curiosity and understanding of their own decision-making.\n\nPart 2 builds on the framework introduced in Part 1 in the context of a real study on fish <AnchorLink href=\"#background\"> see Background </AnchorLink>. Students will analyze box plots (a type of graph similar to bar plots) to test whether female darters prefer a model fish painted a color that is most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e cones in their retinas). Students will reflect on how basic research on fish applies to humans.\n\nPart 3 perfectly blends art, math, and science by testing whether creatures that have proportions outside the range of humans makes them inherently creepy or cute. For this lesson, we created an original set of creature designs that have scaled dimensions which students will use to collect data and calculate proportions. They will then conclude whether having certain proportions (e.g. a large ratio of leg-to-torso-length) far above or below the range of humans makes a creature inherently creepy or cute.\n\nCollectively, this lesson should leave students with a nuanced understanding of how human (and other animal) brains process different sensory stimuli to affect preferences and behavior. It's a great starting-off point for deepening interest and engagement for independent projects."

        "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n In this three-part lesson, students will follow in the footsteps of scientists (analyzing real, published data), but also conduct their own novel experiments. Overall, our hope is that students will recognize that science and data are everywhere and give us insight into ourselves.  \n#### Research Background\n Parts 1 and 3, students will run their own experiments, testing novel hypotheses related to their own preferences. For these activities, we developed a conceptual framework that is woven into all lesson parts. This framework is explained in our video [\u25b6 I Like That! How our eyes and brains interact to determine what we like and dislike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw8OoXGIsj8). We want students to understand in general terms how our brains perceive things detected by our senses, and then incorporate prior experience and emotional responses to form preferences that affect their behavior. This is based on research in humans and other animals. Though human \"emotions\" can be very complex, many animals from primates to bees show a range of positive <-> negative responses to stimuli that can be interpreted as emotions. If students are interested in learning more about emotions in animals, here are some excellent scientific articles targeted at young readers:\n- [*Frontiers for Young Minds* | Animal Emotions\u2013Do Animals Feel as We Do?](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.622811)\n- [*Frontiers for Young Minds* | Your Smile Caught My Eye: Why Do Emotional Things Catch and Hold Our Attention?](https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2022.781748)\n\nIn Part 2, students will learn about how our eyes detect and process different colors (i.e. different wavelengths of light). They learn key background from [\u25b6 How we see color - Colm Kelleher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8_fZPHasdo) and [\u25b6 The Science of Color Perception](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poL7nDmqjmk). \n\nIn our original video: [\u25b6 How do we know what a fish likes? (And can we predict it?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGmPIHPX9eQ), Drs. Tamra Mendelson and Tory Williams talk about their work on darters, a fascinating and beautiful group of fish native to North America (see supplementary vid: [\u25b6 Darter facts: the colorful little fish | Animal Fact Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnD1d4pIxO4)). \n\nIn the scientific study students will learn about, the researchers tested whether female darters were most attracted to colors that were most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e. cones found in the retina). Students will follow in the scientist's footsteps, first making predictions and then analyzing their authentic data. The video and presentation will guide students through interpreting graphs of sensitivity curves to make their predictions. \n\nBasically, there were two models of male fish used to test female preferences. They were colored \"red\" and \"orange\" to mimic extremes of natural variation. Looking at the graph below, the place where the 2 sensitivity curves overlap is the light wavelength that should be most stimulating to females' eyes. That is, light that has a wavelength of about 550nm should maximize activation of both the medium and long wavelength cone cells in the retina. The question is: do females prefer a model with an average reflectance closest to this wavelength? \n\n![Sensitivity curves for darters. A dashed line shows medium wavelength cone sensitivity, peaking around 580nm, while a solid line shows long wavelength cone sensitivity peaking around 580nm. The curves overlap at 550nm. Arrows point to orange model fish, showing the peak reflectances of the orange model fish at 570nm and the red model at 584 nm](https://gp-catalog.vercel.app/lessons/ILikeThat_en-US/darter_vis_sensitivity_curve.png)\n\nThe video and presentation guide students through interpreting this graph\u2014to predict that females should prefer the orange model. Our video explains the experimental setup, but here it is briefly: Individual wild-caught females were put in the middle of a tank which had two tanks on either side of it. Model fish simulating extremes of natural variation in male colors were placed on either side of the female tank. An observer recorded what proportion of time females spent associating with the \"red\" versus the \"orange\" male model. Students will observe the patterns in the data and determine that females had a strong preference for the orange model. They will then draw conclusions about why this research matters more broadly and hopefully begin to wonder--how are our daily decisions affected by our sensitivity to different stimuli? This could be a great jumping-off point for independent research/PBLs. <AnchorLink href=\"#extensions\"> See Extensions </AnchorLink>\n\n![Cover of journal article](https://gp-catalog.vercel.app/lessons/ILikeThat_en-US/paper.png)\n[Link to Journal Article](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/24/6/1407/190166)\n",
