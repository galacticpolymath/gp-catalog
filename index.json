        "Description": "This lesson teaches students about data visualization (how to read and interpret scatter plots, dot plots, and histograms), and connects to a broader theme of how our assumptions affect our conclusions. Students learn how scientists and birders alike have assumed for decades that most female birds don't sing. As students explore real data from a recent study, they will learn how this assumption could be reinforced by the fact that females sing much less than males, and further, how this biased oversight has limited our understanding of bird research from its very beginnings. <AnchorLink href=\"#background\"> See Scientific Background </AnchorLink> for details.\n\nThe lesson will take 3 class periods for most learners. Students dive in with a data literacy puzzle, which we call a \u201cPolymath Puzzle.\u201d Students are given a figure from a current scientific study on barn swallows (a common bird across the world), but with text elements coded with an alphabetic shift (e.g. each letter is shifted: A to B, B to C, and so on). They have to work in teams (or individually) to decipher the messages, and then try to understand the figure. This is a high-level data literacy task that piques students\u2019 natural love of puzzle-solving, while working on GRIT/grappling and the [21st Century Skills (4 Cs)](https://www.aeseducation.com/blog/four-cs-21st-century-skills). Videos guide students through each stage of the Polymath Puzzle. In Parts 2 and 3, students create and interpret histograms from the same data, allowing for a deeper understanding of the pros and cons of scatter plots and histograms for visualizing data patterns. The culminating task is for students to synthesize the conclusions from the two types of graph, along with additional background information to hypothesize a reason for why female song has been missed until 2020 in this widely studied species."

The Polymath Puzzle in Part 1 draws students into decoding the labels on a graph in order to engage them in trying to understand the next level of meaning in the graph, creating a rich data literacy learning experience. In the first step, students learn that ciphers are used to make a secret message. We use a simple cipher called an alphabetic shift, where each letter of each word in a message has been shifted a certain number of places (e.g. +1 would mean A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on).\nThis section works on assimilating new vocabulary, as well as encouraging students to have a growth mindset. They need to quickly orient themselves to the \"system\" of ciphers and how they work. Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson will build on this engagement hook.",

A common pattern (called a \"normal distribution\") is bell-shaped, with most observations having values close to the average, with about equal, increasingly rare measurements that are very high or very low. Human height is a good example of a normal distribution, with many \"average/medium\" height individuals, and very few individuals being significantly shorter or taller than all the rest.\n- **scatter plot:**  a graph showing the relationship between two continuous variables.

This is self-fulfilling, as females often look similar to males, sing much less in total & only sing early in the breeding season.\n- This is a form of confirmation bias (though we don\u2019t introduce that term), where we may latch onto evidence that confirms our preexisting assumptions. (And we should be wary of that).\n- The scatter plot was a better visualization for this data because it shows the timing of song and when scientists need to focus study of female song to address this gap in our knowledge.\n"

        "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n This lesson allows students to explore the actual data from [the study](https://www.unco.edu/nhs/biology/about-us/benedict-lauryn/documents/publications/Wilkins_et_al_2020.pdf) and to hear from the study\u2019s lead author to deepen data literacy and understanding of the scientific method. Students explore one of the primary figures in the study, a scatter plot (graph) showing different patterns of male and female singing output over the breeding season. Importantly, males sang much more than females and for a longer time (May-Aug, rather than just May). Thus, because males sing more frequently, if we assume (as has been common for birders and scientists until recently) that only males sing, your assumptions are reinforced more easily, because you are less likely to see a female sing.\n\nDuring the peer review process, an anonymous scientist suggested that the scatter plot was not a good way to represent the data, instead suggesting that the authors should have displayed a histogram. In Parts 2 and 3 of the lesson, students aggregate (combine) the authentic study data in order to create a histogram. They must then interpret the data in both formats (deepening their understanding of how histograms and scatter plots relate to each other), and conclude which is a better way to demonstrate the study\u2019s findings, explaining why.\n\nFor further reflection, students are then asked to synthesize what they have learned, along with new information presented to them. Why has female song been missed? Partially because of a pre-existing assumption that females don't sing, along with less common singing behavior in females. Why do females sing less? Because natural selection favors females who sing less. Females must sit on eggs for around 2 weeks, leaving them open to predation. If they were to sing as loudly and provocatively as males, they would attract predators which would eat them or their eggs, passing on no genes. Thus, natural selection has likely caused female song to be lost, simplified, or to be produced for short time periods during establishment of the breeding season in many species around the world. \n#### Research Background\n ![studyThumbnail.png](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/assumptionsMatter_femalesSing_math/study-paper.png)\n[Link to the scientific study](https://www.unco.edu/nhs/biology/about-us/benedict-lauryn/documents/publications/Wilkins_et_al_2020.pdf)\n\nThis lesson is based on a recent study that describes female song in barn swallows for the first time. Barn swallows are one of the most common birds in the world and have been the subject of more than 1000 studies, yet published birding field guides and scientific papers have all failed to describe female song or they describe it incorrectly as being the same as male song (females have their own song type). This is an important oversight, because research on male bird song has informed a lot of theory in biology about how populations evolve through mate choice and competition involving vocal communication, and how new species form. \n\nIgnoring the sounds females make may result from inherent biases. Since bird song became an area of scientific study in the 1800s, it was almost exclusively researched by white males in the Northern Hemisphere. Since women have become welcomed into all areas of science, and research institutions have focused more intent study in tropical regions of the world, studies have discovered that female song is the ancestral state (i.e. the ancestor of all living song birds had both singing males and females). Moreover, female song has not been entirely lost in most species. As in the barn swallow, natural selection has favored females that sing less often, and to have more concise songs that are often restricted to the pre-egg-laying part of the breeding season. This drop in female singing after egg-laying is thought to stem from trying not to draw predators to nests. Due to lack of study, the full function of song in competition among females, male mate choice, or other functions is not well understood in most species.\n\nFurther Reading: \n- [Why We Didn't Know That Female Birds Sing](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-it-took-so-long-to-appreciate-female-birds-songs/): Two authors of the study this lesson is based on discuss its broader implications for society and K-12 education.\n- [Female birds sing.

I love how it combines actual research and allows the students the opportunity for analysis. I also love the fact that the peer review process is included in the explanation for the types of graphs used. This really allows students to see and understand the scientific process in action. Love it!!  \n> **Overall Rating:** 5/5  \n> **Student Engagement:** 4/5  \n> **Overall Learning:** 5/5  \n> **Would Recommend to Other Teachers:** 5/5  \n> **Student Level:** Grade 8  \n>   \n> \u2013Sarah Huneycutt, Homeschool Teacher in Nashville, TN\n\n#### Students\n> I really enjoy this lesson! It is so engaging and fun! \n>  \n> \u201311th Grader in Nashville, TN\n\n> I think it looks like a very interactive lesson and it will hopefully be engaging and interesting to some students. It looks uncomplicated and it gives you all of the resources you will ever need for the lesson. The fact that it shows you how to create graphs and diagrams in the individual powerpoints is a good attribute in my opinion. \n> -11th Grader in Savannah, GA\n  \n> My biggest takeaway from the lesson was the importance of choosing the right way to display data...I don\u2019t have any negative feedback\u2026I really liked the lesson and appreciated how it was interactive and not just a lecture, like many of my online classes have become.\n>  \n> \u201311th Grader in Nashville, TN",

The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students\u2019 curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (M\u0101ori) dye technology.",

        "Description": "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the colors we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a brief but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology. There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart 1 is a \u201cstudent expert\" / [\"jigsaw\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)) activity, where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000-year-old dyeing method that uses sea snails); T\u0101nekaha Red (a traditional M\u0101ori dye derived from tree bark); and mauveine (the first synthetic dye\u2014created from fossil fuels\u2014and invented by a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on students' understanding of these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability, cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately, this lesson aims to broaden students\u2019 conception of what technology is and to better understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as a career.\n"

Students will gain wonder and appreciation for how diverse animal mating systems are while doing fun activities and analyzing real data.\n#### Hooks\n- Part 1: Highly interactive card-based activity that simulates data collection + amazing animal videos\n- Part 2: Atmospheric videos of Borneo, first person narrative of an early career Latina scientist + use of authentic data \n",

        "Description": "This lesson puts students in the role of scientists, collecting and analyzing real data to answer questions. In Part 1, students \"collect\" data through a card-based activity called \"Role With It.\" Briefly, students get a male or female card of 1 out of 12 species. When their card is called, students introduce it with a \"song\" and dance that match the attributes of the species it represents. The class then records data on sexual signal exaggeration and parental investment for that species. \n\nOnce they have collected all 24 specimens (cards) students analyze this data (for Part 2) to generate a general observation: \"across nonhuman animal species, females tend to be more caring (contributing more parental investment), while males tend to be more adapted to attracting and competing for mates.\" These are known as *conventional sex roles.* Students then identify *sex-role-reversed species,* such as jacanas (a bird) and guardian frogs, which have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females\".\n\nPart 3 lets students use real data to test whether the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavenensis*) is truly the first known sex-role-reversed frog species, with \"caring males\" and \"competitive females\". The lesson begins with an atmospheric video that immerses students in the sights, sounds, and mysteries of the island of Borneo. Students are then given a brief introduction to the geography of the region and learn that Borneo is claimed by three Asian countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei). The rest of the lesson focuses on Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos' research in the forests of Brunei. Students test hypotheses by synthesizing information and analyzing a scatter plot to determine that this fascinating species is indeed the first frog known to have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" \n\nThe lesson offers a wide variety of opportunities for student movement, collaboration, creativity, and active engagement.\n"

Dr. Johana Goyes-Vallejos shows that in the smooth guardian frog of Borneo (Limnonectes palavanensis) this is not the case and that female frogs call, too, producing spontaneous vocalizations to attract males. Dr. Goyes-Vallejos\u2019 discovery that female frogs call suggests that L. palavanensis exhibits a reversal in calling behavior and possibly a sex-role-reversed mating system, which would be the first ever observed in a frog species.

        "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n Instead of telling students that a pattern exists, we have them discover it for themselves. That is, rather than telling them, \"In animal species with *conventional sex roles,* males invest more in attracting and competing for mates, while females invest more in parental care,\" we have students collect data in a fun, interactive format and draw this conclusion from the data. They are then more invested in understanding cases of *sex role reversed species* that are the exceptions to this rule, and have \"caring males\" and \"competitive females.\" \n\nIn part 2, students follow in the footsteps of an early career Latina scientist, Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos, testing the same hypotheses she did during her PhD research. Students analyze a real graph and table she collected on the island of Borneo to determine if the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*) is the first sex-role-reversed frog species known to science. (It is!) \n#### Research Background\n Watch [\u25b6'Do Female Frogs Call?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eX5abcrmE7g&t=170s) to get a nice summary of Dr. Johana Goyes Vallejos\u2019 scientific journey.\n\nWhile pursuing a PhD in ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut, Johana heard about a poorly studied frog called the Smooth Guardian Frog (*Limnonectes palavanensis*), found only on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. In a couple of scientific papers in the 1980s, a researcher had described a highly unusual behavior--the males guard eggs hidden under the leaf litter (thus, the common name of the species). When the eggs hatch, the male then carries the tadpoles (on his back!) to small pools of water where they can develop into adult frogs.\nJohana, who was deeply interested in parental care behavior decided to fly to the tiny sultanate of Brunei (ruled by a sultan, rather than a king) and learn about this frog herself. She established a study population, tracking individuals and recording audio of frog calls, often on her own at night, wading through thick mud and fording streams. During her observations, she noticed a tiny peep. It sounded very different from the male calls she had been used to hearing. After careful observation, she confirmed that indeed, these were female calls, which had never been described before by anyone. (See [\u25b6'Calling behavior of male and female Guardian Frogs'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAqSHDdTKMw))\n\nOut of 8,000+ known frog species, Johana had found one of only a couple that are known to have calling females. Previously, scientists had thought females might be physiologically incapable of producing calls. In contrast, when she started focusing on female calling behavior, she found that they were actually calling *more* than males! Students will recapitulate this finding by analyzing a figure showing male and female calling rates.\n\nAs [Borneo is now being heavily deforested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_Borneo), populations of Guardian Frogs are declining. In the final assignment, students are asked to synthesize everything they\u2019ve learned to write a persuasive paragraph about why these exceptional frogs matter and what we stand to lose if they are lost. \n\n#### Researcher Bio\nDr. Johana Goyes Vallejos is a Preparing Future Faculty for Faculty Diversity Postdoctoral Fellow in the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Missouri, Columbia. She graduated with a B.Sc. in Biology with a minor in Genetics from the Universidad del Valle in Cali, Colombia. She received her Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the\nUniversity of Connecticut, studying mating systems, parental care behavior, and acoustic\ncommunication in frogs. Her research has taken her to many tropical forests across the\nworld, including Panama, Costa Rica, Guyana, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei\nDarussalam. \n\nAt the University of Missouri, Dr. Goyes Vallejos continues her research on\nmating behavior and parental care strategies using frogs with elaborate parental behaviors\nas study systems. In addition, since 2018, she serves as a research mentor for an NSF-\nfunded Research Experience for Undergraduates program in Costa Rica, providing\nhands-on training in animal behavior and field research to undergraduate students\nbelonging to minoritized groups in STEM. She is passionate about sharing her research findings with scientific and non-scientific audiences through various media outlets. When not chasing frogs in remote forests around the world Dr. Goyes Vallejos enjoys salsa dancing, storytelling and crocheting amigurumis. \n\n[Learn more about Johana at her website](https://jogoyesvallejos.weebly.com/)\n\n#### Further Reading and Listening\n- [The Shape of The World Podcast: When the girl frog sings](https://shapeoftheworldshow.com/2019/05/04/episode-10-when-the-girl-frog-sings/) (May 2019)\n- [FrogLife.org| Female communication in anurans: duets, ultrasonic calls and sex-role reversal](http://www.froglife.org/2019/08/29/croaking-science-female-communication-in-anurans-duets-ultrasonic-calls-and-sex-role-reversal/) (August 2019)\n- [National Geographic Espa\u00f1a| Los padrazos del mundo de los anfibios](https://www.nationalgeographic.com.es/ciencia/grandes-reportajes/padrazos-mundo-anfibios_13763) (March 2019)\n- [The New York Times| \u200bDevoted Dads of the Amphibian World](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/science/frogs-parenting-reproduction.html) (December 2018)\n- [KU Today| Extraordinary 'faithful father' revealed by study of smooth guardian frog of Borneo](https://today.ku.edu/2018/12/13/research-smooth-guardian-frog-borneo-details-extraordinary-faithful-father) (December 2018)\n- [Science Magazine: These female frogs are the first of their kind to croon to their guys](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/these-female-frogs-are-first-their-kind-croon-their-guys)\u200b (June 2017)\n- [Science & Vie| Chez la grenouille de Born\u00e9o, c'est madame qui chante](https://www.science-et-vie.com/nature-et-enviro/chez-la-grenouille-de-borneo-c-est-madame-qui-chante-8925) (June 2017)\n\n#### Related Scientific Paper\n![Screenshot of scientific journal article](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/guardianFrogs_sci/goyespaper.png)\n[Link to study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C43&q=Calling+behavior+of+males+and+females+of+a+Bornean+frog+with+male+parental+care+and+possible+sex-role+reversal&btnG=)\n",

        "Description": "This lesson equips students with a simple framework for understanding how inputs from our senses are processed in the brain to determine what we like vs. dislike and how we behave. Though the lesson focuses on vision, the framework applies to all the senses. \n\nIn Part 1, students begin by ranking 10 images based on their arbitrary preferences. They then conduct an experiment (taking turns as a \"scientist\" and \"subject\") to try and understand **why** they ranked things the way they did. This is lesson both involves authentic, novel, science, but should also grow students' curiosity and understanding of their own decision-making.\n\nPart 2 builds on the framework introduced in Part 1 in the context of a real study (see #background) on fish. Students will analyze box plots (a type of graph similar to bar plots) to test whether female darters prefer a model fish painted a color that is most stimulating to the sensory cells in their eyes (i.e cones in their retinas). Students will reflect on how basic research on fish applies to humans.\n\nPart 3 perfectly blends art, math, and science by testing whether creatures that have proportions outside the range of humans makes them inherently creepy or cute. For this lesson, we created an original set of creature designs that have scaled dimensions which students will use to collect data and calculate proportions. They will then conclude whether having certain proportions (e.g. a large ratio of leg-to-torso-length) far above or below the range of humans makes a creature inherently creepy or cute.\n\nCollectively, this lesson should leave students with a nuanced understanding of how human (and other animal) brains process different sensory stimuli to affect preferences and behavior. It's a great starting-off point for deepening interest and engagement for independent projects."

This basic framework is adapted from human and animal behavior research. We use this framework throughout the middle school-targeted lesson below. In the lesson, students perform an experiment to understand their own preferences and dive into research on fish, exploring how sensitivity to different frequencies of light affects mate preferences. We dive into this topic in detail in our second video supporting this lesson.",
            "lessonRelevance": "This video sets up key vocabulary and concepts we will use throughout this lesson. It sets up activities that will have students trying to understand how emotion, memory, and higher-order connections explain their own preferences for certain images.",

The rest of Part 1 focuses on narratives designed to appeal to students\u2019 curiosity.\n- Part 2 involves a card-based puzzle activity. \n- Part 3 puts students directly in the decision-maker position, giving them an opportunity to choose a course of action based on their own values and reasoning.\n#### Learning Summary:\nStudents will learn to think like chemical engineers as they delve into the dye technologies that allow us to express ourselves through colourful clothing. They will read and discuss complex texts, analyse concept maps and graphs, and develop an appreciation for indigenous (M\u0101ori) dye technology.",

        "Description": "Students will gain a deep appreciation for the technology behind the colours we use to express ourselves in our everyday dress. This lesson offers a brief but deep dive into chemical engineering through the lens of dye technology. There are 3 parts, each expected to take about one 45-minute class period. \n\nPart 1 is a \u201cstudent expert\" / [\"jigsaw\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_(teaching_technique)) activity, where student groups number off into 3 subgroups. Each subgroup will read an article about a dye technology, fill out a concept map to understand the chemical process described, and teach this process to their group mates. The three technologies students will learn about are: Tyrian Purple (a 4,000-year-old dyeing method that uses sea snails); T\u0101nekaha Red (a traditional M\u0101ori dye derived from tree bark); and mauveine (the first synthetic dye\u2014created from fossil fuels\u2014and invented by a teenager in the 19th Century).\n\nPart 2 builds on students' understanding of these three dye technologies by challenging them to work together in groups to solve an engineering puzzle. They are given a set of 18 cards representing steps in a dyeing process. Students will figure out the correct sequence for all three dye technologies. Each step also has an associated cost, and students will add up the costs, calculate a starting price, and begin to reflect on the pros and cons of each technology. \n\nPart 3 puts students in the position of a chemical engineer who has to choose one of these technologies, taking into account a wide variety of factors. The presentation walks students through the interpretation of a graph showing how price scales with how many dyed items are being produced. They will develop data literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills as they interpret and discuss the various tradeoffs of each technology in terms of price, sustainability, cultural significance, and the ability to serve the demands of everyone. Ultimately, this lesson aims to broaden students\u2019 conception of what technology is and to better understand the value of engineering, whether or not they decide to pursue it as a career.\n"

            "lessonRelevance": "For Part 3: Students watch this video at the end of the unit to learn about the many sustainability issues tied to the dye and fashion industries (particularly with fossil-fuel-derived synthetic dyes). This supports student reflection and analysis as they perform a cost-benefit analysis of the technologies to make a recommendation.",

        "Description": "Students learn about genetic rescue, an approach for helping endangered populations recover by introducing closely related individuals from a different population. The lesson is framed around the story of Florida panthers, which are a classic success story for genetic rescue. In Part 1, students explore Florida panther recovery through the lens of different stakeholders (ranchers, city-dwellers, and Native Americans), discussing ways that each group may have positive or negative associations with panthers. \n\nIn Part 2, they then explore different options for helping panther recovery, discussing pros and cons of genetic rescue, captive breeding, or doing nothing. \n\nPart 3 provides necessary scaffolding for a deeper dive into genetic rescue by explaining key concepts in the context of Florida panthers. Students also do a card-based activity simulating matings to better understand why inbreeding and recessive traits are so problematic in small populations.\n\nPart 4, goes deeper into genetic rescue: what can go wrong? Students provide evidence of their understanding of how all the concepts connect through a concept mapping exercise, interspersed with our carefully crafted explainer videos. A key take-home is that even though genetic rescue worked in Florida panthers, it's quite risky to test out conservation strategies on an endangered species. The concluding task is to analyze a table of organisms and their characteristics to determine which would be good models to study the effectiveness of genetic rescue without risking a rare species' extinction. \n\nPart 5 builds on this to reveal Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick's (this lesson's sponsor) research using Trinidadian guppies as a model of genetic rescue. Students then spend much of the class period analyzing real, paired data collected from Florida panthers and guppies. They are asked to compare and label graphs from both species, and synthesize broader conclusions. The lesson leaves open many options for project-based lessons and independent projects."

Here, we learn what happened and how wildlife managers tried to bring them back. Through this story, we explore connected concepts of how habitat fragmentation affects the flow of genes, and how this can lead to increasing risk of extinction in endangered species (the \"Extinction Vortex\"). The video ends with an open-ended question about what common species we could use to study endangered species recovery so that we don't run the chance of inadvertently destroying what we're trying to save.\nCheck out the lesson at https://www.galacticpolymath.com/lessons",

        "Content": "#### Connection to Research\n How do we save endangered species? This lesson deals with one option called *genetic rescue*\u2014a conservation strategy that involves moving individuals from one population into an endangered population that is highly inbred in order to add genetic variation to enable population recovery. Students learn about two distinct lines of research: one measuring the success of an attempt to save endangered Florida panthers; the other using wild Trinidadian guppies as a model of endangered species in order to better understand details of how genetic rescue can succeed or fail. \n#### Research Background\n Watch this video for a lot of panther background: [\u25b6'What is genetic rescue, and can we use it to save endangered species?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFQmNq8sJ2Y&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=2)  \n\nThe Florida panther is a unique subspecies (*Puma concolor coryi*) of the American puma (*Puma concolor*). It's not to be confused with black panthers, which are the dark (melanistic) forms of leopards or jaguars. The Florida panther was nearly driven to extinction by habitat loss, fragmentation, and targeted hunting. In the mid-1990s, there remained only a tiny ~20 individual population of panthers in south Florida, and they were highly inbred. They had a lot of recessive genetic abnormalities, including visible, superficial traits like: kinked tails and cowlicks in their fur, to more significant problems like: cryptorchidism (undescended testicles, causing infertility in males) and heart defects. Wildlife managers decided to relocate 8 female pumas from Texas (*Puma concolor couguar*) into Florida to introduce needed genetic variation.  \n\nStudents will get to analyze 20 years worth of monitoring data to assess whether genetic rescue was successful (it was! There are now over 200 Florida panthers). At the same time, students will compare these results to a paired data set in Trinidadian guppies to understand how model organisms can be used to answer scientific questions that are difficult to answer in an endangered or difficult-to-study species.\n\n#### Related Florida Panther Paper:\n![screenshot of panther study paper](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/VanDeKerk_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wmon.1041)\n\n\nThis video connects genetic rescue research on Florida panthers to the Trinidadian guppy model species: [\u25b6'Saving a species through genetic rescue: Why we need model organisms'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiXyHxv4Sx4&list=PLz-D3xOC0d88kLYQLB9xeUz7gAaO1JJZb&index=3)\n\nTo study many details of genetic rescue in a model system where we don't have to worry about inadvertently driving a species extinct, Dr. Sarah Fitzpatrick and colleagues went to Trinidad. They took advantage of previous experiments that had moved guppies from a downstream population that had lots of genetic variation into upstream pools with only a few, highly inbred fish. \n\nThis genetic rescue experiment was indeed successful, and after only a few months, genetic variation increased and the population rebounded from around 20 individuals to over 1,000.\n\n\n#### Related Guppy Paper:\n![screenshot of Scientific Study](https://catalog.galacticpolymath.com/lessons/geneticRescue_sci/fitzpatrick_paper_screenshot.png)\n[Link to study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12356)\n\n#### Further Reading\n- [USFWS Florida Panther Profile](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/florida_panther/wah/panther.html)\n- [Nat Geo: Planned roads could imperil Florida's panthers\u2014and last remaining wilderness](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/florida-toll-road-threatens-wildlife-panthers?loggedin=true)\n- [The Florida Panther: Past, Present and Future](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/UW402)\n- [America\u2019s cat is on the comeback](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/americas-cat-is-on-the-comeback)\n- [Of kings and Alpine Ibex: the amazing resurrection of a species from near-extinction](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/posts/59792-of-kings-and-alpine-ibex-the-amazing-resurrection-of-a-species-from-near-extinction)\n",

Summarize how human activities fragment animal populations and how habitat fragmentation limits gene flow, reducing genetic variation.\n3. Predict how increasing genetic variation by introducing new individuals (i.e. by conducting genetic rescue) will impact population size.\n4. Create a logic model showing how genetic rescue occurs; i.e. how the introduction of new individuals to a small, inbred population on the verge of extinction provides needed genetic variation for the population to survive and recover.\n5. Demonstrate understanding of how reduction in both population size and genetic variation in endangered species lead to the \"extinction vortex\"\u2014the increasing likelihood of small populations to blink out due to low population size and recessive genetics from inbreeding.\n6. Propose a model organism to use for research on species that are endangered or infeasible to study.\n7. Interpret scatter plot data from a model organism (Trinidadian guppies) and compare to related data in an endangered species (Florida panthers) to draw broader conclusions about the effectiveness of genetic rescue.\n8. Assess the potential risks and benefits of genetic rescue for a particular species, and propose a course of action.",
